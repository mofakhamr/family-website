          <p>I have very little information about Haj-Mirza-Jabbar TASKEREH-CHI, as I have not managed to find any records.</p>
          <p>HOPEFULLY SOMEONE, SOMEWHERE, SOMEDAY MAY PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION THAT I CAN INCLUDE IN THESE PAGES.</p>
          <p>Haj-Mirza-Jabbar TASKEREH-CHI "Nazem-ol-Moham" was born around 1775* in Khoy, a city in Southern Azerbaijan. 
            He was one of the King's trustees who dealt with all matters regarding Azerbaijan and after a few years in charge 
            of the Passport Office, where he got his name from "TASKEREH-CHI"  meaning (in charge of passports).</p>
          <p>He was sent to Baghdad as Consulate General. On his return to Iran he was put in charge of Mines and Industry. As 
            a favourite of Naser al-Din Shah Qajar, he was put in charge of the "Etefagheye" paper and press (1850), which 
            was translating the news from the international press and presenting it to the public.He had three sons 
            Hadj-Hassan-Ali KHOII, Hadj-Hossain-Ali KHOII and Hadj-Safar-Ali KHOII.</p>
          <p>I have no doubt that it was due to his efforts and connections that his sons were welcomed into the Iranian 
            Diplomatic Corp.*= This is only an estimated guess allowing 25 years per generation.</p>
